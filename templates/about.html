About VT Course Search
</h2>
<p>
	VT Course Search is my attempt at doing something the current system is lacking. Everybody has camped drop/add for a coveted class before,
	with this website, you won't have to anymore.
	VTCS is a webapp written in python designed to be used only during the DROP/ADD portion of the school year at Virginia Tech.
	Currently the way DROP/ADD works for courses when you are enrolled at Virginia Tech is on a first come, first serve basis.
	Meaning you have to camp drop/add if you ever hope to get a course that you want to take for a semester.
	So I thought, why not automate it? I'm a CS major, and I can improve upon their system.
	I am drawing on my knowledge from my Systems and Networking course to help automate the system.<br>
	Please note that neither I nor this website are affiliated in any way with Virginia Tech.

Technical Details
</h2>
<p>
	The entire system is written in Python using the Web.py module. I use Beautiful Soap for parsing the "Classes Timetable" portion of Virginia Tech's website.
	Beautiful Soap allows full DOM integration, even if the HTML tags are malformed (which they are on this site).
	There is currently a very *basic* authentication system in place for user accounts, and database support is being built up as I continue working on the project.
	The storage is a MongoDB server for tracking the submitted requests.
</p>
<br>
<p>
	The back-end is a separate python script that connects to the database at specified intervals and uses a script to check whether or not a course is available.
	If it is, a notification is sent out to the user notifying them of this occurence.

	<!--
		Haha, TODO: After course availability, records will be pruned 3 days after submission, meaning if you miss a slot you will have to resubmit your request if it's been more than three days.
	-->
